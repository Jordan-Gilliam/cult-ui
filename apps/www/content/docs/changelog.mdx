## April 2024 - Introducing Cult UI Components

We're introducing a new mode for [Blocks](/blocks) called **Lift Mode**.

Enable Lift Mode to automatically "lift" smaller components from a block template for copy and paste.

<a href="/blocks">
  <Image
    src="/images/lift-mode-light.png"
    width="1432"
    height="1050"
    alt="Lift Mode"
    className="border dark:hidden shadow-sm rounded-lg overflow-hidden mt-6 w-full"
  />
  <Image
    src="/images/lift-mode-dark.png"
    width="1432"
    height="1069"
    alt="Lift Mode"
    className="border hidden dark:block shadow-sm rounded-lg overflow-hidden mt-6 w-full"
  />
  <span class="sr-only">View the blocks library</span>
</a>

With Lift Mode, you'll be able to copy the smaller components that make up a block template, like cards, buttons, and forms, and paste them directly into your project.

Visit the [Blocks](/blocks) page to try it out.
